I started trying to program in Apporto on my Macbook but decided using my desktop PC was a better tool. I was right, as I was able to run the program on my PC, but there were build errors, so I had to build and run the last successful build. Following this, an error message popped up on my screen: "Unable to open file d:\temp\SNHU2\OpenGLSample\OpenGLSample\Debug\Source.obj. Error code = 0x80070003.
I looked up the error code in a search engine and found a stackoverflow question which suggested it might be looking from the file in a path which does not exist on my PC. This issue makes it so I am unable to change the name of the window by editing the Source file, since it is using an earlier build version.
I have also tried updating everything, but my computer crashes when it tries to restart, which impedes progress. I am hoping to bring it to a computer repair store.
